# Components Folder

This folder holds all the components used in building an application.

**/ui:**

In this folder, we can further group UI primitives into a seperate folder called **ui**. Basically, a UI primitive is a small standalone component that is not made of other components.

Other general components can live directly in the components root folder. A general component in this case will be components that are made up of other components.
