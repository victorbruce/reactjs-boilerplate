# Services Folder

This folder holds any type of service an application might consume:

For example:

- **/api**: fetching an api endpoint
- **/i18n**: implementing different languages within an application
- **/state**: handling global state
- **/providers**: for any shared data(mostly context) that can be wrapped around the root component of an application. In other words, any sort of provider an app might use.
