# Pages Folder

This folder is where all the **root level pages** a user can navigate to will live.

It defines the entire **structure** or **skeleton** of an application and how a user can navigate through it.

**For example:**

- Home Page
- About Page
- Dashboard Page
- Login Page

**NB:** You can customize this folder in any way you deem it fit for the application you are building. There is no one fit solution.
